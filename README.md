# Clean XSS Injector ðŸ§¨

A powerful Go-based tool for hunting XSS vulnerabilities in web applications. This tool combines multiple reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning techniques to identify possible Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Multiple scanning strategies** - Choose from 5 different XSS hunting techniques
- **Tool detection & auto-installation** - Automatically detects required tools and offers to install them
- **Linux optimization** - Specifically designed for Linux environments
- **Multithreaded execution** - Parallel processing for faster scanning
- **Dynamic URL optimization** - Uses uro/gouro for URL optimization

## Prerequisites

- Go (1.15 or newer)
- Linux environment
- Internet connection (for tool installation)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `xss-linux.go` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MalikHamza7/XSS-Injector.git
cd Clean-Xss-Injector
```

2. Build the tool:

```bash
go build xss-linux.go -o xss
```

3. Run the tool:

```bash
./xss
```

## Required Tools

The following tools will be automatically installed if not already present:

- `httpx` - HTTP toolkit for probing web servers
- `waybackurls` - Fetch URLs from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine
- `gf` - Pattern matching tool for grepping
- `qsreplace` - Query string replacement tool
- `gospider` - Fast web spider
- `uro` - URL optimization tool (or `gouro` as an alternative)
- `dalfox` - XSS scanning tool

## Usage

When you run the tool, you'll be presented with a menu of XSS hunting options:

ðŸ§¨ Clean XSS Injector - XSS Payload Hunting Tool
==============================================

Available XSS Hunting Options:
1. Wayback + httpx + GF + Dalfox
2. Gospider + Dalfox
3. Wayback + GF + Blind XSS via Dalfox
4. Gospider + Dalfox (Deep Crawl)
5. Dalfox Direct with Blind XSS

### Option 1: Wayback + httpx + GF + Dalfox

Grabs wayback URLs for domains, filters for parameters (=), applies XSS pattern using gf, replaces the value with a script, and checks if the payload is reflected.

### Option 2: Gospider + Dalfox

Crawls and finds parameterized URLs using Gospider, replaces their values, and pipes them to Dalfox for XSS testing.

### Option 3: Wayback + GF + Blind XSS via Dalfox

Fetches old URLs from Wayback, filters for XSS candidates, sanitizes them to allow blind XSS testing, and sends to Dalfox with a callback domain for detection.

### Option 4: Gospider + Dalfox (Deep Crawl)

Conducts a deeper crawl using Gospider and tests found URLs for XSS vulnerabilities using Dalfox.

### Option 5: Dalfox Direct with Blind XSS

Sends URLs directly to Dalfox for blind XSS detection using a given callback domain.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
chmod + x xss
./xss
```

Then select an option from the menu, provide a domain or file with domains, and optionally your XSS hunter subdomain for blind XSS detection.

### Input Files

The tool accepts text files with one domain or URL per line. For example:

```
example.com
test.example.org
https://vulnerable-site.com
```

## Output

Results from each scan are saved to text files in the current directory:

- `xss_results_wayback_httpx.txt`
- `xss_results_gospider.txt`
- `xss_results_blind.txt`
- `xss_results_deep_crawl.txt`
- `xss_results_dalfox_direct.txt`
